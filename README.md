## About This Project
Years ago when I was enrolled at a coding boot camp at the University of Denver, one of our first complex projects was to create a Friend Finder application.
It was my first time working with Node.js, jQuery, and Express.js and while the program's functionality was fine, I was not very impressed with the
result.  I decided to revisit the project and utilize my expanded technical knowledge to create greater functionality, a more robust survey, and a more
appealing and complex UI/UX.
